.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
libgphoto2(3)
is a cross\-platform digital camera library, and
gphoto2(1)
is a command\-line client for it.
.PP
Where an option takes a
\fIRANGE\fR
of files, thumbnails, or other data, they are numbered beginning at 1. A range is a comma\-separated list of numbers or spans (\(lq\fIfirst\fR\-\fIlast\fR\(rq). Ranges are XOR (exclusive or), so that
\(lq1\-5,3,7\(rq
is equivalent to
\(lq1,2,4,5,7\(rq.
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
.RS 4
Turn on debugging output. Debugging output is written to stderr by default, or to the filename given to the
\fB\-\-debug\-logfile\fR
option.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\-logfile\fR \fIFILENAME\fR (since 2.3.0)
.RS 4
The logfile to write the debugging info to, if
\fB\-\-debug\fR
is given.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-hook\-script\fR \fIFILENAME\fR (new after 2.3.0)
.RS 4
Execute the hook script
\fIFILENAME\fR
every time a certain event happens within
\fBgphoto2\fR. The hook script reads the environment variable
\fBACTION\fR. It must ignore
\fBACTION\fR
values unknown to it.
.RS 4
.PP
\fBACTION\fR=init
.RS 4

\fBgphoto2\fR
has just been initialized. If the hook script returns with a non\-zero exit code now,
\fBgphoto2\fR
will abort.
.RE
.PP
\fBACTION\fR=start
.RS 4

\fBgphoto2\fR
has just finished parsing the command line and is about to start executing the commands given on the command line.
.RE
.PP
\fBACTION\fR=download
.RS 4

\fBgphoto2\fR
has just downloaded a file to the computer, storing it in the file indicated by the environment variable
\fBARGUMENT\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fBACTION\fR=stop
.RS 4

\fBgphoto2\fR
is about to finish. Do your final cleanups here.
.RE
.RE
.IP "" 4
All other environment variables are passed to the hook script unchanged. You can make use of that to pass data to the hook script.
.sp
Hook script may be specified in the
\fI~/.gphoto/settings\fR
file as
\fBgphoto2=hook\-script=\fR\fIfilename\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Quiet output (default=verbose).
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Display version and exit.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display a short usage message.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-list\-cameras\fR
.RS 4
List supported camera models.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-list\-ports\fR
.RS 4
List supported port devices.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-stdout\fR
.RS 4
Send file to stdout.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-stdout\-size\fR
.RS 4
Print filesize before data.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-auto\-detect\fR
.RS 4
List auto\-detected cameras and the ports to which they are connected.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-port\fR \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Specify port device. The
\fB\-\-list\-ports\fR
prints a list of valid, usable ports. In case of multiple USB cameras, the
\fB\-\-auto\-detect\fR
shows you the specific port each camera is connected to.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-speed\fR \fISPEED\fR
.RS 4
Specify serial transfer speed.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-camera\fR \fIMODEL\fR
.RS 4
Specify camera model. The
\fB\-\-list\-cameras\fR
option prints a list of all explicitly supported cameras.
.sp
Most model names contain spaces: remember to enclose the name in quotes so that the shell knows it is one parameter. For example:
\fB\fB\-\-camera\fR\fR\fB "Kodak DC240"\fR.
.sp
Note that if you specify
\fB\fB\-\-camera\fR\fR, you must also specify
\fB\fB\-\-port\fR\fR. Otherwise the
\fB\fB\-\-camera\fR\fR
option will be silently ignored.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-filename\fR \fIFILENAME\fR
.RS 4
When downloading files from the camera, specify the file name or file name pattern to use when storing the downloaded file on the local disk. When uploading a file to the camera, specify the filename to store the uploaded file as on the camera.
.sp
The
\fB\-\-filename\fR
option accepts %a, %A, %b, %B, %d, %H, %k, %I, %l, %j, %m, %M, %S, %y, %%, (see date(1)) and, in addition, %n for the number, %C for the filename suffix, %f for the filename without suffix, %: for the complete filename in lowercase.
.sp
Note that %: is still in alpha stage, and the actual character or syntax may still be changed. E.g. it might be possible to use %#f and %#C for lower case versions, and %^f and %^C for upper case versions.
.sp
%n is the only conversion specifier to accept a padding character and width: %03n will pad with zeros to width 3 (e.g. print the number 7 as
\(lq007\(rq). Leaving out the padding character (e.g. %3n) will use an implementation specific default padding character which may or may not be suitable for use in file names.
.sp
Default value for this option can be specified in the
\fI~/.gphoto/settings\fR
file as
\fBgphoto2=filename=value\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-usbid\fR \fI\fIUSBIDS\fR\fR
.RS 4
(Expert only) Override
USB
IDs.
\fI \fR\fI\fIUSBIDS\fR\fRmust be of the form
\fI \fR\fI\fIDetectedVendorID\fR\fR\fI:\fR\fI\fIDetectedProductID\fR\fR\fI=\fR\fI\fITreatAsVendorID\fR\fR\fI:\fR\fI\fITreatAsProductID\fR\fR
to treat any USB device detected as
\fI\fIDetectedVendorID\fR\fR\fI:\fR\fI\fIDetectedProductID\fR\fR
as
\fI\fITreatAsVendorID\fR\fR\fI:\fR\fI\fITreatAsProductID\fR\fR
instead. All the VendorIDs and ProductIDs should be hexadecimal numbers beginning in C notation, i.e. beginning with '0x'.
.sp
Example:
\fB\-\-usbid \fR\fB\fI0x4a9:0x306b=0x4a9:0x306c\fR\fR

.sp
(Since 2.4) If
SIGUSR1 signal
is received, a picture is taken immediately without waiting for the end of the current interval period (see
the section called \(lqSIGNALS\(rq). A value of \-1 will let gphoto2 wait forever, i.e. until a signal arrives. See also
\fB\-\-reset\-interval\fR (since 2.4).
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-reset\-interval\fR (since 2.4)

when a
SIGUSR1 signal
is received in time\-lapse mode.

\fB\-\-capture\-tethered\fR

Lets gphoto2 wait for notifications from the camera that an object was added. This is useful for tethered capture, where pressing the shutter on the camera immediately transfer the image to the machine for processing.
.sp
Together with the
\fB\-\-hook\-script\fR
to immediately postprocess or display the images this can help a studio workflow.
.sp
This option requires support in the driver and by the camera, currently only Nikon DSC are known to work.
