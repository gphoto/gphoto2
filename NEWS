   and capture image.

   * nr of events (200)

gphoto2 2.4.99.2

 * Updated for new GPPortInfo in libgphoto2 2.5.0
 * Updated for various changed file interfaces in libgphoto2 2.5.0

 * Capture mainloop changed to handle JPEG+RAW capture (one release
   resulting in 1 or more files).
   (Also: refactored and rewritten to be more beautiful)
 * Capture mainloop uses trigger capture + waitevent if present.
 * Fixed use-after-free problem in file save
 * Fixed %n to use an incremental counter, instead of a filesystem index.

gphoto2 2.4.10.1

 * Switched %n behaviour to be linear increasing, instead of
   a folder index.

gphoto2 2.4.10

 * Event loop handling non-waitevent able cameras.

 * --capture-movie (optional arguments: frames, or seconds)
   now loops over preview capture as fast as possible
   and writes the frames continuously.

   The resulting file is "MotionJPEG" and can be postprocessed
   or displayed (by mplayer).

   Also output to stdout is possible for pipeing like:
           gphoto2 --stdout --capture-movie | someotherprogram

gphoto2 2.4.9

   to also support multiple image captures. (JPEG+RAW)

 * On --filename "foo/bar/berk.jpg" create subdirectories if

	capture-preview
 * Added Bulb Mode in interval capture with -B / --bulb <seconds>

gphoto2 2.4.7

 * New cmdline options: --set-config-index and --set-config-value
   to avoid ambiguity of the --set-config supporting both modes.
 * --wait-event can take "5s" as argument for 5 seconds of event taking
 * added --wait-event-and-download=x (same as --wait-event but with download)
 * New shell commands:
	   wait-event (events or seconds)
	   wait-event-and-download (events or seconds)
	   capture-tethered 
	   set-config-index entry=choiceindex
	   set-config-value entry=value

   --capture-image split into:
	 --capture-image		: Just captures image, no download.

  * Fix: --get-all-metadata takes no argument.
  * Use the "UNIX fd" based CameraFile handling code for downloading and uploading
    files, without using system memory.
    FIXME: For a release, do require a libgphoto2 version with the
           proper version number at compile time, and/or check linking
           with that function.

gphoto2 2.3.0
