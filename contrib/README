Contributed scripts, docs, etc.
========================================================================

In this directory, you can find scripts and other things contributed by
users. They may be useful as they are, they may need some work to be use-
ful for you, or they may not help you at all... you'll have to judge them
yourself.

You can see a list of contributions with a short summary below.
